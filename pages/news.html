                            produce moments of magic</h3>

                            The Gunners endured a frustrating first 40 minutes against 
                            Sean Dyche's side but Bukayo Saka's superb opener, rifled 
                            home from Oleksandr Zinchenko's incisive pass shortly before half-time, 
                            set them on their way to a commanding victory.
                            Gabriel Martinelli added a second in first-half stoppage time when 
                            a VAR check ruled him onside after he was initially flagged offside, 
                            with Martin Odegaard scoring the third in the second half before 
                            the Brazilian added his second to wrap up the victory.

                        <p class="news_paragraph">
                            We’re just four days past the All-Star break, but also just two days 
                            from the 3/4 mark of the season, which will come Tuesday night.
                            Urgency is high across the league, especially in the Western Conference, 
                            where there are still just three games in the loss column separating 
                            the fourth-place Phoenix Suns (33-29) from the 13th-place Oklahoma City 
                            Thunder (28-32). Kawhi Leonard is finally playing heavy minutes, 
                            LeBron James is trying to fight through injury, and Kevin Durant is 
                            expected to make his Suns debut this week.

                            The Eastern Conference remains the stronger conference, with its power 
                            concentrated up top. But seeds are still very much up for grabs up and 
                            down the standings, and the streaking New York Knicks suddenly have a 
                            chance at home-court advantage in the first round.
